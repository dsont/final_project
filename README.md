# final_project
This project includes a login page that stores an employees first name, last name, username, and password into a database called EmpDatabase. This database is then translated into a table in emplist.html. The idea is for the Admin to be able to see the data in an organized manner and for a super admin to be able to modify it.

#TheProblem
The resturaunt Sanders Sandwiches is having trouble keeping track of Employee login and the information (i.e. Username and Password) that coincides with each employee.

#TheSolution
The solution for me was to create a login page for all employees, including admins. This information was then put into a database and compiled into a table. This table seperated the information into columns that had the employees first name, last name, Username, and Password. The regular admins are able to view this information(for things like recovering a username or password) and the super admins are able to modify this information(Delete, Edit, or Add a new record to the table).
